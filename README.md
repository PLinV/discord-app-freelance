# Discord Application Freelance

We make, host and sell Discord applications, the ones just for you.

## Our story 📖

We are two computer science students who live in France. During the last summer we spent our time learned how to make Discord applications. Our goal is to make money on the side as working a job while in engineering school is practically impossible. We are both top of our class, knowing that we quickly understood we could utilise our knowledge to make Discord applications. We've been using the platform for quite some time to understand that it is a viable side hustle and

## The product 🤖

We are offering to make you a Discord Application that can do the following:

- Moderation ⚒️
- Logging 📜
- Music\* 🎵
- Game Statistics 📊
- Your custom feature ✨

\* _Allowing up to 384Kbps for compatible music providers and [Discord servers](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/11635925354775-Audio-Bitrate-FAQ)_

## The technical side of things ⚙️

We are making our applications using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and TypeScript. Therefore, you can rest assured, the application will not crash and can take on a heavy amount of requests. Our offer includes one year of hosting on a server with resources suitable for a 100k members Discord server.

In the future, we will add an offer where you can get the source code of your app. Right now we keep it on a private GitHub repository. If you buy a Discord Application today you will be able to upgrade.

## The offer 💸

We have a basic offer including everything you've read above.

To avoid any issue we currently use the Revolut Pay system, making you able to pay using Revolut Pay, Google Pay, Apple Pay and using a classic card.

Our current price per application is **75.99€**.

> [!NOTE]  
> We will soon change our payment system to Stripe (or similar) as we think it suits more our type of project. Using the Revolut system is overkill for a project of our size.
